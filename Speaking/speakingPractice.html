                For hundreds of years, Tet has been a traditional festival and
                ritual ceremony across Vietnam. Its importance in spiritual life
                as a break-off period was honored by ordinary people and royal
                dynasties. When Vietnam came into the new world, many things
                happen to change, yet Tet stays as it has been for generations,
                with a few modern twists. From every street, every house, and
                every window, any foreigner could spot that this biggest holiday
                is coming so close. Businesses and schools start to close down
                between the 23rd and 27th of December (Lunar Calendar), for
                students and employees to pack up and head home. Red lanterns
                and Tet-style LEDs are hung up everywhere; commercial
                advertisements now only field Tet-vibe. In some public spots or
                large areas, kumquat trees, peach blossoms, or apricot blossoms
                are planted and decorated. Yet, Vietnamese businesses don’t
                basically stop. Our individual household businesses start weeks
                before Tet. Tet Fiona markets are open in every municipality of
                Vietnam, from small villages to crowded cities, with thousands
                of “Tet” trees. Though both the Southern and Northern regions
                have many common things, Vietnamese people still easily tell
                them apart. Northern Tet’s traditional dishes focus on its
                complexity in detail, layers, and taste; while Southern Tet’s
                traditional dishes focus on its simplicity, folklore-kind in the
                table. However, we still have the same dishes like steamed
                white-cut chicken, deep-fried spring rolls, or sticky rice. In
                the North, people would have ‘Chung’ cake (a square-like cake
                that is stuffed with meat, beans, and sticky rice, covered in
                “dong” or banana leaf and steamed) and sticky rice cake as
                offerings to ancestors; while the Southern people would choose
                “Tet” cake (a similar cake to “Chung” cake but is longer) as
                offerings. Yet, no matter where you are, Vietnamese people
                always reach for the unity of the family, on the, maybe, most
                sacred holiday. Many people who are workers, students, or even
                Vietnamese overseas, try to come back home for a reunion. Hope
                you guys have a beautiful Tet holiday!
